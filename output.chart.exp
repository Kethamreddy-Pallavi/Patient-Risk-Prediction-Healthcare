The bar chart titled "Prediction Distribution" shows how many patients were classified into each risk category by your logistic regression model.

 Chart Explanation:
X-axis (Predicted Risk Label):
This represents the predicted risk level for each patient. In your dataset, the labels are:

0: Low risk
1: Medium risk
2: High risk (if included in future data)
Y-axis (Number of Patients):
This shows how many patients were predicted to fall into each risk category.

What It Tells Is:
If the bar for 1.0 is higher than 0.0, it means more patients were predicted to be at medium risk.
If the bar for 0.0 is higher, it means most patients are predicted to be at low risk.
This helps to understand the distribution of risk in  patient population and whether the model is biased toward predicting a certain class.
